On occupied planets:  
Spy Sat 2 resulted in 88 -> 208
Spy Sat resulted in 88 -> 232

Persol 1 was occupied by Dribs. Flag 1, Visibility 0. Flag 1 seems to mean "visible on the map".
Adding Survey Sat changed Flag to 244. Can now see this is an alien colony. Grey name. ??? on Cratered Planet.
Changing the flag to 0 when the Survey Sat was present caused it to appear bugged. "" on cratered planet. "You must receive more information from your satellite to view the planet surface"
Normally this would say "You must deploy a satellite to view the planet surface."
1,2,4,8,16,32,88 all result in apparently same bugged display. Setting to 144 or 208 brings back "Alien Colony. ??? On Crated Planet" message.

High bit seems to control whether or not the planet is on the list of planets
